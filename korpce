<h1>Korpce</h1>

Korpce was once a sweet and endearing usul that dreamed of nothing more than finding true love among her fellow pets of the Haunted Woods. Though she wasn't like the other morbid pets of her home, she dreamed she would find someone among them with a kind heart. One Day, she found her prince under the colorful scattered light in the Deserted Carnival. It was love at first sight and her longing heart felt whole at last. They were to be wed in Edna's tower the following day; they couldn't wait to spend the rest of their lives together. 
<br><br>
She believed she owed her fairy tale all to her dear friend Edna. She had gone to Edna in the past to console her lonely heart. Edna had taken great interest in the lovely young Usul and promised that she would find love at last if only she completed her a quest to bring her a Mutant Transmogrification Potion. She did what Edna asked without question; she would do anything to find true love and she was grateful to the witch for helping her achieve her dream at last. 
<br><br>
The night she dreamt of had arrived at last. As she climbed the tower steps, her heart beat faster with each pace. She pictured the warm smile and kind eyes of her beloved Kau in her mind. 

She finally arrived at the top at laid eyes of her fiance. "WHAT IS THIS?!", she screamed in horror. Before her stood a horrible monster that could only be described as morbid. He opened his mouth of tentacles and roared at the frozen Usul. She fell backwards onto the ground, staring into his eyes. She looked deeply into the dark eyes of the beast in search of the pet she knew but he had been lost. He was consumed by rage, madness and pure evil. She trembled in fear as Edna approached the young Usul. "You didn't really think I would let you have him all to yourself did you? If you still want him, serve me for all eternity and I will return him to the Kau you remember. Together we will concur these lands and rule the Haunted Woods forever. When my dream comes true, only then will I give you yours" Edna said chuckling in excitement. 
<br><br>
The young Usul fled to the woods with tears in her eyes. She was terrified and her dreams had been crushed by the one person she thought she could trust. 
<br><br>
She wandered the woods for many days before she grew weary and tired. Her body gave out all at once, falling into a deep slumber beneath the moon light. 
<br><br>
She did not realize that all along, someone had been watching her. When she woke, she saw a familiar face; It was the Evil Thade. The Evil Thade is a puzzle master Kacheek who takes pride in solving difficult situations. Thade had came to her aid in the past and proved herself an allie not to be trifled with but evil she was not. 
<br><br>
The Kacheek promised her revenge, love and a life her own for nothing in return. The Thade only desired to see her lifelong rival Edna get what was coming to her. 
<br><br>
The Thade took in the young Usul as an apprentice and promised her great power, enough power to defeat the malicious witch Edna and take back what was meant to be hers. Korpce now serves the Evil Thade her in dark castle, longing for the day she's strong enough to take her revenge.<br><br>
